Hi here you will find my thoughts about sddm

_This is my playground, be aware of this!_

That are examples for my personal use and test.

I share them, but you have to keep in mind, that software could eat your pet!

__To use it, you do it on your own risk!__

Now some Words to the themes:

- deepspace is originally made for [siduction](https://siduction.org "siduction homepage")

 But for technical reasons, we had to change some things there, only the repository is named to deepspace, because of historical reasons.
 [sddm-theme-deepspace](https://github.com/siduction/sddm-theme-deepspace "the side on github").

 The themes for siduction have other release names!

- mammoth has just another background and i play more with the technik, so it is better to use deepspace, you can change the background by your own!
- Take a look to the sources!

What is needed:
- sddm
- QtQuick 2.0 (normaly it should be automagicly installed together with sddm)
- QtGraphicalEffects 1.0 (qml-module-qtgraphicaleffects)

How to install?

Just copy the theme folder to /usr/share/sddm/themes/
 
_I try to keep them up to date, but i cant give any guarantee that it will be just in time!_
