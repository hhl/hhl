Hi here you will find my thoughts about sddm

_This is my playground, be aware of this!_

That are examples for my personal use and test.

I share them, but you have to keep in mind, that software could eat your pet!

__To use it, you do it on your own risk!__

Now some Words to the themes:

- deepspace is originally made for [siduction](https://siduction.org "siduction homepage")

 But for technical reasons, we had to change some things there, only the repository is named to deepspace, because of historical reasons.
 [sddm-theme-deepspace](https://github.com/siduction/sddm-theme-deepspace "the side on github").

 The themes for siduction have other release names!

- mammoth has just another background i play with!

 (I am planing to create, a grub2 theme and a kf5/kde-splash screen with that mammoth thing. (okay i am working on, but it need time to grow))
 
_I try to keep them up to date, but i cant give any guarantee that it will be just in time!_
