I upload the script sakis3g Version 0.2.0e to github because www.sakis.org seems to be down.

Sorry that i took the bit outdated version, but i do not have a newer one.

usb-modswitch and usb-modswitch-data and libusb-dev are needed to run the script.

Copy it to /usr/local/bin make a chmod +x on it, and start it as $user.

Search the internet for more informations.
