I upload the script **sakis3g Version 0.2.0e** to github because www.sakis3g.org seems to be down.

Sorry that i took the bit outdated version, but i do not have a newer one.

usb-modswitch and usb-modswitch-data and libusb-dev are needed to run the script.

Copy it to /usr/local/bin make a chmod +x on it, and start it as $user.

Search the internet for more informations.

**Install and us it on your own risk, it could eat your pet!**

**Please do not ask me for help or support, i cant give it to you!**

I done it for my privat use, because some times this little tool is verry helpfull, and i dont wanna loose it.
